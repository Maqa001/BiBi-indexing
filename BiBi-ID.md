# 📌 What Is a BiBi ID?
BiBi ID is a unique identifier assigned to each academic journal that is indexed in the BiBi Indexing database. It serves as a standardized reference number for tracking, listing, and verifying journals accepted into the BiBi indexing system. Each journal is assigned a unique BiBi Indexing ID — a standardized 7-digit alphanumeric code designed to uniquely identify the journal within the BiBi database.

# 🧾 Purpose and Importance:

* The BiBi Indexing ID acts as an official code verifying that the journal is recognized and indexed by BiBi.
* This unique identifier promotes transparency and trust, helping authors, readers, libraries, and indexing services to confirm the journal’s indexing status quickly and reliably.
* It supports proper cataloging and easy integration of journal metadata across multiple platforms and repositories.

# 🧾 Usage Guidelines:

* The BiBi Indexing ID must be prominently displayed on the journal’s cover page and on the first page of every article published in the journal.
* Additionally, the ID should be clearly visible on the journal’s official website, preferably on the homepage or in the "About" or "Indexing" sections.
* Consistent usage of the BiBi ID in all official journal materials ensures the integrity of indexing records and assists in tracking citation and publication metrics.


# 🧩 BiBi ID Format
The BiBi ID follows a standardized format for easy identification:

BIBI: 0000000

🔹 Example: BIBI: 0000000

This ID is permanently assigned to the journal upon acceptance into the BiBi Index.

# 📂 Where Is the BiBi ID Used?
Once assigned, the BiBi ID will appear in:

* The BiBi Indexed Journals List (Google Spreadsheet or Web Directory)
* Indexing certificates (if provided)
* Journal profile pages (if applicable)
* Internal BiBi records and verification databases
