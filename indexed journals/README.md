# 📄 Journal Indexing Information for BiBi Submission
Following the successful acceptance of our journals into the BiBi Indexing database, we have created a dedicated index to formally present and organize all relevant information about each journal.

This system is designed specifically to meet BiBi’s requirements for journal-level indexing, focusing on transparency, completeness, and ease of access.

# 🗂️ Journal Index Contents
Each journal is listed with the following key information:

* Journal Title
* ISSN (Print and/or Online, if available)
* Publisher Name
* Country of Publication
* Year of Establishment
* Publishing Frequency (e.g., Quarterly, Biannual, Annual)
* Languages of Publication
* Editorial Board Information
* Scope and Subject Areas
* Contact Information (Email, Phone, Address if required)
* This information is prepared and formatted in accordance with BiBi Indexing guidelines and international standards.

# 📊 Google Spreadsheet for Submission
All journal information is collected and maintained in a Google Spreadsheet, which serves as the official index file for submission to BiBi. The spreadsheet is:

* Clearly structured and easy to review
* Continuously updated as new journals are added
* Publicly accessible or shareable with indexing bodies

👉 This spreadsheet will be used as the primary file for submitting journal metadata to BiBi Indexing.

# ✅ Purpose of This Repository
This indexing system — including the Google Spreadsheet — has been created specifically to organize and submit journals for indexing in the BiBi Indexing database. At this stage, article-level archiving is not required. The focus remains on the successful listing of journals, their details, and eligibility.
