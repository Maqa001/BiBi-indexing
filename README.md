# 📌 BiBi ID for Journals
The BiBi ID is a unique identification code assigned to each journal indexed by the BiBi platform. This ID functions as an official reference number that verifies a journal’s inclusion in the BiBi indexing system.

Journals are required to display their BiBi ID prominently on key materials such as the cover page, the first page of every article, and on their official website. Using the BiBi ID consistently helps ensure transparency, authenticity, and easy verification of the journal’s indexed status.

The BiBi ID strengthens the journal’s credibility and facilitates accurate tracking and referencing within academic and research communities.

# 📊 After the successful completion of the indexing process in BiBi Indexing, the journal’s details—including its title, ISSN, publisher, indexing status, and other relevant metadata—will be automatically added to the designated Google Spreadsheet (Excel).

You will be able to view, manage, and track your journal’s indexing status directly from this spreadsheet. This integration provides a convenient and transparent way to monitor the progress and visibility of your journal within the BiBi Indexing system.

Please note that it may take a few moments for the data to appear after the process is finalized. If your journal does not show up after a reasonable period, please contact the support team for assistance.
